> Reliability engineering is a sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes the ability of equipment to function without failure. Reliability describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.[1] Reliability is closely related to availability, which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time. The Reliability function is theoretically defined as the probability of success as at time t, which is denoted R(t). This probability is estimated from previous data sets or through reliability testing. Availability, Testability, maintainability and maintenance are often defined as a part of "reliability engineering" in reliability programs. Reliability can plays a key role in the cost-effectiveness of systems; for example, a consumer product in many cases will have a higher resale value, if it fails less often. [[1]](#1).
